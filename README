Bio-Graphics-Glyph-decorated_gene version 0.01
==============================================

The two glyphs in this package extend the functionality of the Bio::Graphics::Glyph::gene 
and the Bio::Graphics::Glyph::processed_transcript glyph and allows to draw protein decorations 
(e.g., signal peptides, transmembrane domains, protein domains) on top of gene models. Currently, 
the glyph can draw decorations in form of colored or outlined boxes inside or around CDS segments. 
Protein decorations are specified at the 'mRNA' transcript level in protein coordinates. Protein 
coordinates are automatically mapped to nucleotide coordinates by the glyph. Decorations are allowed 
to span exon-exon junctions, in which case decorations are split between exons. By default, the 
glyph automatically assigns different colors to different types of protein decorations, whereas 
decorations of the same type are always assigned the same color.
