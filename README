Bio-Graphics-Glyph-decorated_gene version 0.03
==============================================

This package contains two BioPerl glyphs, Bio::Graphics::Glyph::decorated_gene and Bio::Graphics::Glyph::decorated_transcript, that extend the functionality of BioPerl's 'gene' and 'processed_transcript' glyphs by drawing and labeling protein decorations (such as signal peptides, transmembrane domains, protein domains) on top of gene models. 

Currently, decorations can be drawn in the form of colored or outlined boxes inside or around CDS segments. Protein decorations are specified at the 'mRNA' transcript level in protein coordinates. Protein coordinates are then automatically mapped to nucleotide coordinates by the glyphs. Decorations are allowed to span exon-exon junctions, in which case decorations are split between exons. By default, different colors are assigned automatically to different types of protein decorations, whereas decorations of the same type are assigned the same color. 

Please refer to module descriptions of Bio::Graphics::Glyph::decorated_gene and Bio::Graphics::Glyph::decorated_transcript for a detailed description of how to use and parameterize the glyphs.
